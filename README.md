## Overview
I have extensively used `flexbox` to implement this layout. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process
I started with the mobile design and scaled the design for larger screens. It was tough to align the contents properly with the change in screen size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I got some practice in making responsive cool layouts like these. 

### Continued development
In future I would like to get myself familiar with CSS `grid`. For this challenge I have used only `flexbox` since I couldn't make it work with `grid`.
